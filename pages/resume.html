                <p>This certificate is split into 7 parts. The first part is the introduction of what a UX designer does and their importance. The next part goes onto the skill sets a UX designer will need to succeed, which is being able to empathize with the user and their problem, defining their problem, and then ideating a solution for the problem. At the start of the third part of the course, it gives you a year's subscription on Figma, a tool to create, share, and test designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products and experiences. The third part then moves onto what wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes are and their benefits. This part also goes into detail of how to find your research, test your ideas, and then refine those ideas and designs to have a more polished start for your high-fidelity wireframe/prototype. The fourth part of the course moves you onto taking your low-fidelity design and making it into a high-fidelity wireframe/prototype. From here if you feel like your work is not up to your standard, then you could always go through a usability test. The fifth part focuses on the importance and how you would scale your design to fit other screen sizes. The second to last step of the course is to test your ability to use all that you have learned and create a new design that will solve a problem in your community. The last part of the course helps you know what to expect when applying for a UX designer, how to better connect yourself with other UX designers, and that you should make an online portfolio of your work. Overall each part focuses on the steps to becoming a well rounded UX/UI designer before you make the choice to be a generalist or specialist. I completed the course over the span of 6 months at 10 hours a week through Coursera, an online course provider.Â <p>

                <p>I started this certificate after getting the UX certificate, because this was my passion project before the end of the school year. This certificate is an introduction to a web developer, but after a year in being in a front-end web development class, I can say that this course was really bare bone, without any real depth to it. But I have to give credit where credit is due, the course at that time did give me a feel of what a web developer does. If I could summarize this course, it would be a crash course on the terms web developers use, how developers use HTML and CSS to design a website, and really condensed information on what the internet is and what goes on behind the screen(back-end developer).</p>
