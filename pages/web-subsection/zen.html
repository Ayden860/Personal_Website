                    CSS Zen-Garden was one of the earlier assignments I
                    had in class, getting me accustomed to how css works and what to code in CSS.
                    This asignment came with a challenge to test and improve your skills in CSS.
                    The challenge was to only use CSS and
                    style a reputable website with a HTML file you
                    could not touch.

                    Another requirement in the assignment was to use all 43 CSS
                    selector tags on a google sheets. I remember as I was completing the
                    list of tags, I had to search up examples of what some of the CSS
                    selectors did, to know how to use that CSS selector to work on one particular
                    HTML element, to show change. Once I knew a CSS selector could actually
                    show change to an HTML element I would change the styling to back to how the
                    HTML element looked like before. If I had left the CSS style and not made
                    the HTML element be styled to match the theme I was going for, the
                    website would have looked like a rainbow splatter all over the page.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I ended up finishing the assignment a day before the due date.
                    So in that remaining time I add a little bit of fun creating
                    ad pop-ups on the left side of the website. Making the ads was a little
                    challenging because you could not touch any HTML, but in the HTML file
                    there were four empty div(s) at the bottom of the file. Using two of those
                    div(s) I learned how empty div(s) need a width or height in pixels for
                    the div to gain any width or height and how to use background-img: URL().
                    Creating the ads actually helped later down the line because in later assignments
                    I had to create hero images and with the practice of the ads, it
                    reduced the time I had to research on what to do. Looking back I
                    enjoyed the constraints this assignment brought,
                    but I would not like to do this again(especially the checklist).
