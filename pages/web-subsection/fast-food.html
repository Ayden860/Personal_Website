                    This project is based off of a hypothetical
                    prompt of “CART(my high school) was hired by
                    Jurassic Park to make a website to connect all
                    fast food chains for ease of use on the island”.
                    My partner Eric and I worked on the fast food section
                    of the website. While the rest of the class worked on
                    different sections that would be on an amusement park
                    website, the end goal for the class was to then bring
                    it all together to have one website. Spoiler alert, at
                    the end all of those websites did not connect with each
                    other.

                    This was my first ‘major’ project where I had to develop
                    more than 4 pages along with designing the whole thing
                    from scratch. Before this project my instructor was
                    getting us familiar with wireframes, low-fidelity
                    prototypes, high-fidelity wireframes/prototypes, HTML
                    and CSS(this was all in the first semester), not yet
                    getting into JavaScript just yet(we were formally
                    introduced to working with JavaScript in the second
                    semester).

                    Starting on figma for the overall design of
                    the website, I would say I was the one who
                    mainly made the layout and picked the colors
                    from a limited range of colors(see the image above). I don’t blame
                    my partner for this because if I remember
                    correctly we had a week for the low-fidelity
                    prototype and the next week was for the high-fidelity
                    prototype. I already had a year of experience in UX
                    working in Figma on designs and we needed the work done
                    fast. For the color scheme of the website we were
                    required to only use the colors that Jurassic Park
                    used. A lot of the colors did not
                    really fit the theme of a fast food website, along with
                    conflicting color contrasts. So I chose a monotone green
                    color scheme.

                    It's been a while and I do not remember in detail,
                    but I do remember that Eric and I were working on this
                    project after school on hours long calls.
                    Looking back, if I were to recode this website,
                    it would take less time and from the many hours of
                    work Eric and I put in, I could probably make this
                    project better than before.
