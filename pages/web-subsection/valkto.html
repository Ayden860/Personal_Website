                    Escape from Valkto is a school assignment and 
                    my partner (Kaiden) and I were tasked to make a 
                    text adventure made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    The plot of the game follows a monomyth cycle and 
                    is based on the sci-fi genre. The setting of the game crash
                    lands you on a hostile enemy planet with the overarching 
                    goal is to find survivors, fight enemies, and call the 
                    Mother Ship to come rescue you.

                One of the main activity we had to do to 'finish' 
                this project was writing it out in Lucid Chart.
                With Lucid Chart we were able to map out what 
                dialogue choices you had and organize the overall 
                story to flow together more smoothly.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the end though we were running out of time with 
                dead lines and re-creating a format to have an error 
                free card placement for the dialogue options. Not 
                only did we have a deadline, I feel like both me 
                and my partner ran out of steam for the project near 
                the very end where most of the story needed to be 
                coded into the JavaScript, so the game would work.
