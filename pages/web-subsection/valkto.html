                    Escape from Valkto is a school assignment and
                    my partner (Kaiden) and I were tasked to make a
                    text adventure made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    The plot of the game follows a monomyth cycle and
                    is based on the sci-fi genre. Before you start the game you will
                    randomly be chosen to start one of the three unique beginnings.
                    Not going in order, one of the beginnings starts you off by crash
                    landing the player(soldier) on a hostile enemy planet with the overarching
                    goal is to find survivors, fight enemies, and call the
                    Mother Ship to come rescue you. Another beginnings starts the player
                    from a perspective of another survivor(Dan) and the starting point is near
                    where the soldier starts off, but after meeting up with the soldier
                    the player's pov shifts back to the soldier. The last beginning is
                    a much slimmer chance of getting, but if the player does get this beginning
                    they automatically avoid the crisis of crash landing on the enemy planet
                    Valkto and the game ends.

                    One of the main activity we had to do to 'finish'
                    this project was writing it out in Lucid Chart.
                    With Lucid Chart we were able to map out what
                    dialogue choices you had and organize the overall
                    story to flow together more smoothly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the end though we were running out of time with
                    dead lines and re-creating a format to have an error
                    free card placement for the dialogue options. Not
                    only did we have a deadline, I feel like both me
                    and my partner ran out of steam for the project near
                    the very end where most of the story needed to be
                    coded into the JavaScript, so the game would work.
