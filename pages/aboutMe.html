                <p>Games that I have taken an interest in are mainly mobile games, because I grew up not being able to play PC games or console games. Now the reason I don’t play PC or console games is because I do not have as much time and mobile games do not take as much of your time.</p>

                <p>Something about colors that stand out(dark or light) just turns on a section of my brain. You can see some of the games I play have an anime esc art style with pretty colors throughout its game play. Take for example Honkai Star Rail, all of the characters have their own vibrant color scheme for their design along with their 3 possible actions they can make(basic attack, skill, ultimate). </p>

                <p>This certificate is split into 7 parts. The first part is the introduction of what a UX designer does and their importance. The next part goes onto the skill sets a UX designer will need to succeed, which is being able to empathize with the user and their problem, defining their problem, and then ideating a solution for the problem. At the start of the third part of the course, it gives you a year's subscription on Figma, a tool to create, share, and test designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products and experiences. The third part then moves onto what wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes are and their benefits. This part also goes into detail of how to find your research, test your ideas, and then refine those ideas and designs to have a more polished start for your high-fidelity wireframe/prototype. The fourth part of the course moves you onto taking your low-fidelity design and making it into a high-fidelity wireframe/prototype. From here if you feel like your work is not up to your standard, then you could always go through a usability test. The fifth part focuses on the importance and how you would scale your design to fit other screen sizes. The second to last step of the course is to test your ability to use all that you have learned and create a new design that will solve a problem in your community. The last part of the course helps you know what to expect when applying for a UX designer, how to better connect yourself with other UX designers, and that you should make an online portfolio of your work. Overall each part focuses on the steps to becoming a well rounded UX/UI designer before you make the choice to be a generalist or specialist. I completed the course over the span of 6 months at 10 hours a week through Coursera, an online course provider. <p>
