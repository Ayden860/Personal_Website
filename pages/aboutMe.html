                <p>Games that I have taken an interest in are mainly mobile games, because I grew up not being able to
                    play PC games or console games. Now the reason I don’t play PC or console games is because I do not
                    have as much time and mobile games do not take as much of your time.</p>

                <p>Something about colors that stand out(dark or light) just turns on a section of my brain. You can see
                    some of the games I play have an anime esc art style with pretty colors throughout its game play.
                    Take for example Honkai Star Rail, all of the characters have their own vibrant color scheme for
                    their design along with their 3 possible actions they can make(basic attack, skill, ultimate). </p>

                <p>This certificate is split into 7 parts. The first part is the introduction of what a UX designer does
                    and their importance. The next part goes onto the skill sets a UX designer will need to succeed,
                    which is being able to empathize with the user and their problem, defining their problem, and then
                    ideating a solution for the problem. At the start of the third part of the course, it gives you a
                    year's subscription on Figma, a tool to create, share, and test designs for websites, mobile apps,
                    and other digital products and experiences. The third part then moves onto what wireframes and
                    low-fidelity prototypes are and their benefits. This part also goes into detail of how to find your
                    research, test your ideas, and then refine those ideas and designs to have a more polished start for
                    your high-fidelity wireframe/prototype. The fourth part of the course moves you onto taking your
                    low-fidelity design and making it into a high-fidelity wireframe/prototype. From here if you feel
                    like your work is not up to your standard, then you could always go through a usability test. The
                    fifth part focuses on the importance and how you would scale your design to fit other screen sizes.
                    The second to last step of the course is to test your ability to use all that you have learned and
                    create a new design that will solve a problem in your community. The last part of the course helps
                    you know what to expect when applying for a UX designer, how to better connect yourself with other
                    UX designers, and that you should make an online portfolio of your work. Overall each part focuses
                    on the steps to becoming a well rounded UX/UI designer before you make the choice to be a generalist
                    or specialist. I completed the course over the span of 6 months at 10 hours a week through Coursera,
                    an online course provider.
