                    Near the end of my UX Design year, my class was given
                    the opportunity to have internships with Harris Ranch Resort.
                    There were many projects Harris Ranch gave us (UX students)
                    to do. Some of the projects I remember being listed off were:
                    how to improve on what(their website, calls for food/booking/customor
                    service, and Tesla users) could be more acessible, surveys on Tesla
                    owners and why they do not go into the stores while their Tesla
                    charges, create a map of the resort, online customer reviews, finding pain
                    points when people visit Harris Ranch Resort, making a brochure,
                    redesigning furniture, and many more. These are just some of the many
                    tasks Harris Ranch wanted done.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While doing these tasks, we found pain points that were
                    commonly recurring, so we ideated potential solutions
                    amongst ourselves and then had our teacher (Mrs. Allen)
                    pitch our ideas to Harris Ranch. Some of the ideas Harris
                    Ranch liked and some they rejected. One of the ideas Harris
                    Ranch liked was the food truck called (something) wagon
                    and that was going to be Harris Ranch's temporary shop
                    for Harris BBQ in Bakersfield. Justin the student who pitched
                    the idea found a food truck he had in mind and created a design
                    for the food truck. After seeing Justin's plan, Harris Ranch
                    went with it and immediately bought the food truck and put
                    the idea into motion.

                    The projects I worked on for Harris Ranch was making (in teams)
                    a brochure for the new Tesla charging stations and finding/ideating
                    pain points from online customer reviews from their BBQ, Resort,
                    Ranch Kitchen, and Prime Steakhouse.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While making the brochure we would design and keep iterating on the design
                    during the week and at the end of the week, Harris Ranch would give
                    us feedback on what they liked and disliked. This kept repeating until
                    Harris Ranch said that they liked the final product.

                    Near the completion of the brochure, Harris Ranch
                    wanted to rebrand their color and move away from
                    their old green color scheme. So as their last
                    request from us, was to change the brochure colors to
                    their new color scheme.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall I enjoyed and learned from this internship with Harris Ranch.
